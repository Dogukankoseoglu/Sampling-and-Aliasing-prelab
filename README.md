# Sampling-and-Aliasing-prelab
This experiment explores concepts such as sampling of a signal and aliasing that may occur
after sampling with the help of MATLAB. This is accomplished through various MATLAB
functions. A list of these functions and their descriptions in the context they are used here
are given in Table 1 as a reference. It is suggested that at least the main functions are well
understood in order to carry out the experiment
